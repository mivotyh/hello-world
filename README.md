Hi
Olivia here. After wasting 20 years in the wonder of purchasing money, I just realised that what made me happy does not necessarily mean anything to the world. The only meaningful way of spending my time is to do the things I feel fine, like what I am doing right now: not worrying about doing nothing practical, but simply enjoy the way of typing & editing a non-sense repository.
